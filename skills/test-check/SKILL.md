Run the full test suite and provide analysis:

1. Detect active project from current working directory or recent context:
   - Check `CLAUDE.md` or `package.json` in the project root for the test command and package manager
   - Common patterns: `yarn test:unit`, `npm run test`, `npx vitest run`
   - Default (no context): ask which project
2. Run the appropriate test command and capture output
3. Report summary: total tests, passed, failed, skipped, duration
4. If failures exist: analyze root cause of each failing test
5. Compare against known baselines:
   - Check `CLAUDE.md` for the documented test baseline count for the active project
   - If no baseline is documented: parse the test summary output line for total count; compare against previous runs if agent memory has a baseline
   - If actual count is higher than baseline, the test suite grew; if lower, investigate missing tests
6. Check if recently modified files have corresponding tests
7. Identify test coverage gaps for critical paths
8. Suggest new tests if coverage is insufficient
9. **E2E tests** (run if user says "e2e", "all", or "full"):
   - Check `CLAUDE.md` for the dev server port and E2E test command
   - Check if dev server is running on that port before proceeding
   - Run E2E test command from `CLAUDE.md` (e.g., `yarn test:e2e` or `npm run test:e2e`)
   - E2E baselines: documented in `CLAUDE.md`
   - Parse Playwright output: passed/failed/skipped counts
   - On failure: note which spec file and test name failed
   - If dev server is NOT running, report and skip (do NOT auto-start)

Present results in a clear dashboard format.
