## Hooks

### "Hooks aren't firing"

**Symptoms:** You configured a hook in `settings.json` but Claude doesn't mention it running, and the expected behavior doesn't happen.

**Causes and fixes:**

1. **Wrong file path in settings.json.** The `"command"` field must point to the actual script location. Check that the path resolves correctly:
   ```bash
   # Test it directly
   bash ~/.claude/hooks/protect-config.sh
   ```
   If the file isn't found, correct the path. On Windows, see [Windows Notes](GETTING-STARTED.md#windows-notes) for path format differences.

2. **Hook file doesn't exist at the expected location.** If you copied hooks from this blueprint, verify they're in `~/.claude/hooks/` (or wherever your settings.json points).

3. **Wrong matcher.** The `"matcher"` field must match the tool name exactly. Common mistakes:
   - `"bash"` (lowercase) won't match -- use `"Bash"`
   - `"write"` won't match -- use `"Write|Edit"` for file operations
   - For MCP tools, use `"mcp__*"` as the matcher

4. **JSON syntax error in settings.json.** A trailing comma, missing quote, or unclosed bracket silently breaks the entire hooks config. Validate your JSON:
   ```bash
   python -c "import json; json.load(open('$HOME/.claude/settings.json'))"
   ```

### "Hook runs but has no effect"

**Symptoms:** The hook fires but doesn't block or modify behavior.

**Causes and fixes:**

1. **Exit code is always 0.** For PreToolUse hooks that should block actions, the script must return exit code 2 (deny). Exit code 0 means "allow." Check that your error paths use `exit 2`, not `exit 1` (which means "error" and shows a warning but doesn't block).

2. **Output goes to stdout instead of stderr.** Hook messages to the user must go to stderr (`>&2`). Messages to stdout are consumed by Claude as tool input.

### "Hook blocks everything"

**Symptoms:** A PreToolUse hook blocks more actions than intended.

**Causes and fixes:**

1. **Matcher is too broad.** `"matcher": "Bash"` fires on *every* shell command. If your hook logic doesn't filter properly, it blocks everything. Add specific command filtering inside the script (e.g., check for `git push` before blocking).

## Agents

### "Agents keep failing" / "Agent tool not available"

**Symptoms:** Claude says it can't spawn agents, or agent invocations fail with errors about missing tools.

**Causes and fixes:**

1. **`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` not set.** This is the most common cause. Add to your `settings.json`:
   ```json
   "env": {
     "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
   }
   ```
   Then restart Claude Code. See [SETTINGS-GUIDE.md](SETTINGS-GUIDE.md#claude_code_experimental_agent_teams) for details.

2. **Model not available on your Anthropic plan.** If an agent specifies `model: opus` but your API key doesn't have Opus access, the agent will fail. Check your plan at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com). As a workaround, change the agent's frontmatter to `model: sonnet`.

3. **Agent .md file not found.** Custom agents must be in `.claude/agents/` (project-level) or `~/.claude/agents/` (global). Claude Code won't find agents in other locations.

### "Agent modifies files it shouldn't"

**Symptoms:** An analysis-only agent (like verify-plan or db-analyst) writes to files or runs shell commands.

**Fix:** Check the agent's frontmatter for `permissionMode: plan`. This restricts the agent to read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob). If the field is missing or set to a different value, the agent has write access. See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for the permission mode table.

## MCP Servers

### "MCP server crashes" / "MCP tool call failed"

**Symptoms:** Tools like `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` or `mcp__context7__query-docs` fail with connection errors.

**Causes and fixes:**

1. **Docker not running (Docker MCP).** The Docker MCP server requires Docker Desktop to be running. Start Docker Desktop, then restart Claude Code.

2. **npx cache stale.** MCP servers installed via `npx -y` can use a stale cached version. Clear the cache:
   ```bash
   npx clear-npx-cache
   ```
   Then restart Claude Code to reinstall the MCP server.

3. **Port conflict.** Some MCP servers bind to specific ports. If another process occupies the port, the server crashes on startup. Check with `netstat -an | grep <port>` or `lsof -i :<port>`.

4. **One-time flake.** MCP servers are external processes that occasionally crash. The blueprint includes a `PostToolUseFailure` hook for MCP tools that instructs Claude to retry once. If it still fails, Claude falls back to non-MCP alternatives (e.g., `curl` instead of Playwright).

### "MCP tools not appearing"

**Symptoms:** You added an MCP server to `.claude.json` but the tools don't show up.

**Causes and fixes:**

1. **Wrong config file location.** Project-level MCP config goes in `.claude.json` in the project root (not `.claude/settings.json`). Global MCP config goes in `~/.claude.json`.

2. **Tools not in the permissions allow list.** After adding an MCP server, its tools must be listed in `settings.json` under `permissions.allow`:
   ```json
   "mcp__context7__resolve-library-id",
   "mcp__context7__query-docs"
   ```
   Or let Claude ask for permission each time (don't add to the list).

3. **Restart required.** MCP servers are loaded at startup. After changing `.claude.json`, restart Claude Code.

## Rules and CLAUDE.md

### "Claude ignores my rules"

**Symptoms:** You wrote specific instructions in CLAUDE.md but Claude doesn't follow them.

**Causes and fixes:**

1. **CLAUDE.md is too long.** Claude Code loads CLAUDE.md into the context window. Very long files (200+ lines) dilute attention -- rules at the bottom get less weight. Keep CLAUDE.md under 100 lines and extract details into topic files or [path-scoped rules](rules/).

2. **Conflicting plugin instructions.** Plugins can inject their own instructions that compete with yours. Audit installed plugins and disable any that override CLAUDE.md or inject prompts on SessionStart. See [README.md](README.md#plugin-compatibility).

3. **Rule is guidance, not enforcement.** CLAUDE.md rules are followed ~80% of the time -- they're guidelines, not guarantees. If something MUST happen, make it a [hook](hooks/). Hooks fire 100% of the time.

### "Path-scoped rules not loading"

**Symptoms:** A rule file in `.claude/rules/` doesn't seem to take effect when editing relevant files.

**Fix:** Check the `paths:` frontmatter in the rule file. The glob pattern must match the files you're editing. For example:
```yaml
---
paths:
  - "server/**/*.ts"
  - "prisma/**"
---
```
This rule only loads when Claude is working with files under `server/` or `prisma/`.

## Settings

### "Settings not taking effect"

**Symptoms:** You changed `settings.json` but Claude's behavior doesn't change.

**Causes and fixes:**

1. **Wrong file location.** Claude Code reads settings from multiple locations with a precedence order:
   - `~/.claude/settings.json` -- global (user-level)
   - `.claude/settings.json` -- project-level (in project root)
   Make sure you're editing the right one. Check which settings are active:
   ```bash
   claude config list
   ```

2. **JSON syntax error.** A single syntax error (trailing comma, missing quote) silently breaks the entire file. Validate:
   ```bash
   python -c "import json; json.load(open('$HOME/.claude/settings.json'))"
   ```

3. **Restart required.** Some settings (especially `env` variables and MCP configurations) are only read at startup. Restart Claude Code after changing them.

### "Permissions not working as expected"

**Symptoms:** Claude either asks for permission when it shouldn't, or doesn't ask when it should.

**Fix:** Check the interaction between `defaultMode` and the `allow` list:
- `"defaultMode": "dontAsk"` + tool in `allow` list = executes silently
- `"defaultMode": "dontAsk"` + tool NOT in `allow` list = still blocked
- Default mode (no `defaultMode` set) = asks for everything not in `allow` list

See [SETTINGS-GUIDE.md](SETTINGS-GUIDE.md#defaultmode) for the full explanation.

### Auto mode classifier blocks legitimate actions

**Symptom:** Claude says "the classifier blocked this action" for something you expected to work.

**Fixes:**
1. **Add the command to your allow list** -- allow-listed commands bypass the classifier entirely
2. **Add context to `autoMode.environment`** -- tell the classifier about your trusted infrastructure (e.g., your GitHub org, internal domains)
3. **Check `claude auto-mode config`** -- see what rules the classifier is applying
4. **Classifier fallback:** After 3 consecutive blocks, Claude will prompt you directly -- approve it once and the pattern is learned

## Cost

### "Cost is higher than expected"

**Symptoms:** Your Anthropic bill is larger than anticipated.

**Causes and how to reduce:**

1. **Stop hook runs Sonnet on every response.** This is the single biggest cost driver in the blueprint. Each response triggers a Sonnet security evaluation. In a 50-response session, that's 50 extra Sonnet calls. To reduce: remove the Stop hook's security prompt (not recommended) or run it only on code-producing responses.

2. **Parallel agent spawns.** Skills like `review` spawn up to 3 agents simultaneously, each with its own context window and token budget. Modify the skill to spawn fewer agents for lower-risk changes.

3. **Always-thinking + high effort.** `alwaysThinkingEnabled: true` with `effortLevel: "high"` maximizes reasoning depth but also token usage. Switch to `"medium"` effort or disable always-thinking for routine tasks.

4. **Agent teams.** Sessions with active agent teams use ~7x more tokens than standard sessions.

**How to track:** The [cost-tracker.sh](hooks/cost-tracker.sh) hook logs session costs to `~/.claude/metrics/costs.jsonl`. Review this file to see which sessions cost the most.

See [SETTINGS-GUIDE.md](SETTINGS-GUIDE.md#cost-implications) for the full cost breakdown and model pricing table.

## Windows-Specific

### "bash: command not found"

**Symptoms:** Hook scripts fail because `bash` isn't recognized.

**Fix:** Claude Code hooks require a bash-compatible shell. On Windows:
- **Git Bash** (recommended): Installs automatically with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). After installation, `bash` is available in Git Bash terminals and in VS Code's integrated terminal (select "Git Bash" as the shell).
- **WSL**: Works but the file system bridge between Windows and WSL adds latency for hook scripts.

See [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md#windows-notes) for the full Windows setup guide.

### "python3: command not found"

**Symptoms:** Some hook scripts fail on Windows because they invoke `python3`, which doesn't exist on Windows (the command is `python`).

**Affected hooks:** `protect-config.sh`, `cost-tracker.sh`, `verify-mcp-sync.sh` -- these use `python3`. Other hooks use `python`.

**Fixes (choose one):**
1. **Edit the scripts** to replace `python3` with `python`
2. **Create an alias** in Git Bash: add `alias python3=python` to `~/.bashrc`
3. **Install Python via py launcher**: `py -3` works on Windows if Python was installed from python.org

### "Permission denied" on hook scripts

**Symptoms:** Running a hook script shows "Permission denied."

**Fix:** On Windows, Unix file permissions (`chmod +x`) are a no-op. Hook scripts run via `bash "path/to/script.sh"` in the settings.json `command` field, which doesn't require execute permission. If you're getting this error, check that:
1. The file path is correct
2. You're running via `bash "path"`, not trying to execute the script directly

### "Hook path not found" / tilde expansion issues

**Symptoms:** Settings.json references `~/.claude/hooks/script.sh` but the hook isn't found.

**Fix:** Tilde (`~`) expansion depends on the shell. In Git Bash, `~` expands to `/c/Users/YourUser`. If hooks aren't found:
1. Try an absolute path: `"command": "bash \"/c/Users/YourUser/.claude/hooks/script.sh\""`
2. Or use the `$HOME` variable: `"command": "bash \"$HOME/.claude/hooks/script.sh\""`

## Syntax Changes

### Deprecated colon wildcard syntax

**Symptom:** Old permission entries like `Bash(npm:*)` stop matching commands.

**Fix:** Replace colons with spaces in wildcard patterns:

```
Before: "Bash(npm:*)"     -- deprecated
After:  "Bash(npm *)"     -- current syntax
```

The legacy colon syntax still works in most versions but may be removed in future releases. The space syntax is the documented standard.
